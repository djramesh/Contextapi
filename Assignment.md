# Context API Assignment

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to assess your understanding of the React Context API and your ability to write Cypress test cases for a React application.

## Instructions

1. Clone the provided GitHub repository: [GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/your-username/context-api-assignment).

2. Navigate to the `context-api-demo` folder and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to set up the React app.

3. Explore the provided React app that uses the Context API. Familiarize yourself with the `ThemeContext.js` file and how it's used in the `App.js` component.

4. Write Cypress test cases to ensure that the theme toggling functionality is working as expected. Use the provided `context-api.spec.js` file as a starting point.

5. Create a new folder named `boilerplate` and copy the entire source code of the React app into it.

6. Modify the code in the `boilerplate` folder to intentionally break the Context API functionality. Remove or modify the relevant parts in the `ThemeContext.js` file.

7. Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.

8. Submit the repository link for evaluation.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correct implementation of the React app using the Context API.
- Proper configuration and execution of Cypress test cases.
- Successful creation of the boilerplate folder with intentionally broken Context API functionality.
- Clear and concise code modifications in the boilerplate folder.
- Proper submission of the GitHub repository link.

Good luck!
